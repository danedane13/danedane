    <!-- PHIVE CONFIGURATION -->

    <!--
        By default, PHIVE stores all PHARs and some additional files containing meta data in ~/.phive.
        You can change the working directory, but it is recommended to stick with it.

        <config home="~/.phive" />
    -->

    <!-- DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT -->

    <!--
        If the dependency you need is listed on https://phar.io, you can simply add the alias to your config.
        Although not recommended, you can leave out the version attribute, so the newest available version will
        be installed.

        <phar name="phpunit" version="^4.6" />
    -->

    <!--
        If the dependency you need is not listed on https://phar.io or you do not want to rely on a central database,
        you can also add an URL pointing to any PHAR to your config or use the github "project/repository" combination.

        <phar url="https://some.tld/tool.phar" />
        <phar url="someone/somerepo" />
    -->
